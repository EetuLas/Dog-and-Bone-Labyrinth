Unity Version : 2022.3.44f1 (LTS)

Controls:
Move the dog by grapping it with MOUSE 1.
Try to get the dog to the bone without touching the walls.
In settings you can change the main volume and also sfx and music differently.

I made everything the instructions told me to do and also i added some small tweaks such as: A volume slider for sfx and music, not only master slider. The ambience sound stops when in gameover/win screens.
